Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and web technologies have made map creation more accessible than ever before. However, a technical understanding of GIS tools is still required to produce cartographic outputs. 
This thesis introduces Prompt2Map, a system that converts natural language queries into web maps using Large Language Models (LLMs). 
Our approach is based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), involving an initial step to extract data from geospatial sources, followed by a mapping step to visualize the data. 
Performance tests conducted over synthetic prompts demonstrate the systemâ€™s effectiveness. 
We also discuss ethical implications of this approach. 
This work contributes to bridging the gap between map consumers and producers, offering a natural language interface to authoritative geospatial data, thereby bringing spatial information closer to the general public.
