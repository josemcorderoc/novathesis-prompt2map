	abstract = {The field of geographic information science has grown exponentially over the last few decades and, particularly within the context of the pervasiveness of the internet, bears witness to a rapid transition of its associated technologies from stand-alone systems to increasingly networked and distributed systems as geospatial information becomes increasingly available online. With its long-standing history for innovation, the field has adopted many disruptive technologies from the fields of computer and information sciences through this transition towards web geographic information systems (GIS); most interestingly in the context of this research is the limited uptake of semantic web technologies by the field and its associated technologies, the lack of which has resulted in a technological disjoint between these fields. As the field seeks to make geospatial information more accessible to more users and in more contexts through ‘self-service' applications, the use of these technologies is imperative to support the interoperability between distributed data sources. This paper aims to provide insight into what linked data tooling already exists, and based on the features of these, what may be possible for the achievement of self-service GIS. Findings include what visualisation, interactivity, analytics and usability features could be included in the realisation of self-service GIS, pointing to the opportunities that exist in bringing GIS technologies closer to the user.},

	abstract = {The trend toward geographic information systems that are more powerful, less expensive, and easier to use seems to be unequivocally a democratizing, counter-technocracy trend, but goes hand in hand with a centralization of the geographic modeling programming that underpins the GIS. These paradoxical trends give the illusion of growing democratization of GIS technology, while in reality, there is a growing danger of a hidden GIS technocracy, owing primarily to the lack of recognition that such a technocracy exists. While the decentralization of the technology is likely to prevent any major widespread cataclysms, individual organizations implementing a GIS may experience problems caused by the implementation of geographic modeling programs that may be inappropriate to their needs. The remedy for such problems is awareness of the hidden technocracy and of the potential for trouble. One way to increase this awareness is to promote the use of lineage information for the geographical models embedded in geographic information systems in the same way that the GIS community has pressed for lineage information on databases.},

	abstract = {Within the academic and popular discussion of neogeography, it is routinely argued that the process of producing and using geographical information has been fundamentally democratised. Neogeography, in contrast to ‘established geography', especially uses the argument that it is for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Similar arguments have been used to praise the growth in Web GIS since the mid-1990s and seem to be persistent in the conceptualisation of these technologies. However, what is the nature of this democracy, and to what extent do the technologies that are used in neogeography fulfil this democratisation promise? In this contribution the framework offered by Andrew Feenberg in his critical theory of technology, and especially his call for ‘deep democratisation', is used to provide a critique of these assertions of the nature of neogeography. The analysis shows that, unlike early critical GIS and the literature on participatory GIS, the analysis of neogeography adopted an instrumentalist interpretation of the technology and its applications. This view claims that technology is value free and that there is a separation between means and ends. This type of argument ignores and disguises the values that are integrated inexorably in advanced technologies. Once the values are exposed and discussed, neogeography becomes far less exciting and transformative. It becomes clear that there is a separation between a technological elite and a wider group of uninformed, labouring participants who are not empowered through the use of the technology. There are also multiple obstacles that limit the democratic potential of neogeography. The analysis progresses by considering the hierarchy of hacking, understood here as the ability to alter and change the meaning and use of a specific technological system. This hierarchy further explains the democratisation potentialities and limits of neogeography. Because of the reduced barriers, neogeography does offer some increased level of democratisation but, to fulfil this potential, it requires careful implementation that takes into account social and political aspects.},

We envision that autonomous GIS will need to achieve five autonomous goals: self-generating, self-organizing, self-verifying, self-executing, and self-growing. We developed a prototype system called LLM-Geo using the GPT-4 API, demonstrating what an autonomous GIS looks like and how it delivers expected results without human intervention using three case studies. For all case studies, LLM-Geo returned accurate results, including aggregated numbers, graphs, and maps.. Although still in its infancy and lacking several important modules such as logging and code testing, LLM-Geo demonstrates a potential path toward the next-generation AI-powered GIS.

To accomplish this, we first created an open-sourced dataset that includes synthetic (AI-generated) and real-world (human-designed) maps at multiple scales with a variety of settings. We subsequently examined four potential ethical concerns that may arise from the characteristics of DALL·E 2 generated maps, namely inaccuracies, misleading information, unanticipated features, and irreproducibility. We then developed a deep learning-based model to identify those AI-generated maps. Our research emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations in the development and use of AI techniques in cartography, contributing to the growing body of work on trustworthy maps.

Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, defining distinct facets of harm and introducing several desiderata to operationalize fairness for LLMs. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies, two for bias evaluation, namely, metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation disambiguates the relationship between metrics and evaluation datasets, and organizes metrics by the different levels at which they operate in a model: embeddings, probabilities, and generated text. Our second taxonomy of datasets for bias evaluation categorizes datasets by their structure as counterfactual inputs or prompts, and identifies the targeted harms and social groups; we also release a consolidation of publicly available datasets for improved access. Our third taxonomy of techniques for bias mitigation classifies methods by their intervention during pre-processing, in-training, intra-processing, and post-processing, with granular subcategories that elucidate research trends. Finally, we identify open problems and challenges for future work. Synthesizing a wide range of recent research, we aim to provide a clear guide of the existing literature that empowers researchers and practitioners to better understand and prevent the propagation of bias in LLMs.},

Hence, aligning LLMs with human expectations has become an active area of interest within the research community. This survey presents a comprehensive overview of these alignment technologies, including the following aspects. (1) Data collection: the methods for effectively collecting high-quality instructions for LLM alignment, including the use of NLP benchmarks, human annotations, and leveraging strong LLMs. (2) Training methodologies: a detailed review of the prevailing training methods employed for LLM alignment. Our exploration encompasses Supervised Fine-tuning, both Online and Offline human preference training, along with parameter-efficient training mechanisms. (3) Model Evaluation: the methods for evaluating the effectiveness of these human-aligned LLMs, presenting a multifaceted approach towards their assessment. In conclusion, we collate and distill our findings, shedding light on several promising future research avenues in the field.

	abstract = {Scenario Generation Language (SGL) is a powerful tool that simplifies geospatial analysis and decision-making processes, removing the requirement for users to have expertise in GIS or SQL. However, users still need to understand the SGL grammar. This paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - LLM (Large Language Model) to generate SGL statements directly from natural language questions. By leveraging the capabilities of GPT-LLM, this approach bridges the gap between user intent and technical query construction, enhancing the usability and accessibility of SGL. It enables decision-makers to interact with geospatial data using familiar natural language queries, without the need for in-depth knowledge of SGL or complex geospatial querying techniques. The integration of natural language processing with SGL empowers users to effortlessly generate accurate and syntactically correct statements, streamlining the analysis process and facilitating scenario exploration. Experimental results indicate that directly utilizing GPT-LLM for geospatial analysis may not yield satisfactory results. However, the approach presented in this paper demonstrates its effectiveness in simplifying geospatial analysis and supporting informed decision-making. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this work we explore the use of neural-retrieval-in-the-loop architectures - recently shown to be effective in open-domain QA (Lewis et al., 2020b; Izacard and Grave, 2020) - for knowledge-grounded dialogue, a task that is arguably more challenging as it requires querying based on complex multi-turn dialogue context and generating conversationally coherent responses. We study various types of architectures with multiple components - retrievers, rankers, and encoder-decoders - with the goal of maximizing knowledgeability while retaining conversational ability. We demonstrate that our best models obtain state-of-the-art performance on two knowledge-grounded conversational tasks. The models exhibit open-domain conversational capabilities, generalize effectively to scenarios not within the training data, and, as verified by human evaluations, substantially reduce the well-known problem of knowledge hallucination in state-of-the-art chatbots.},

Particularly in the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC), the powerful capacity of retrieval in providing additional knowledge enables RAG to assist existing generative AI in producing high-quality outputs. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in language understanding and generation, while still facing inherent limitations such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowledge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest and helpful auxiliary information, Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RA-LLMs) have emerged to harness external and authoritative knowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model's internal knowledge, to augment the quality of the generated content of LLMs. In this survey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in RA-LLMs, covering three primary technical perspectives: Furthermore, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current limitations and several promising directions for future research.

While Large Language Models (LLM) have taken the world by storm, without eliminating or at least reducing hallucination, real-world GenAI systems will likely continue to face challenges in user adoption. In the process of deploying an enterprise application that produces workflows from natural language requirements, we devised a system leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the quality of the structured output that represents such workflows. Thanks to our implementation of RAG, our proposed system significantly reduces hallucination and allows the generalization of our LLM to out-of-domain settings. In addition, we show that using a small, well-trained retriever can reduce the size of the accompanying LLM at no loss in performance, thereby making deployments of LLM-based systems less resource-intensive.},

By adopting LLM as the reasoning core, we introduce Autonomous GIS as an AI-powered geographic information system (GIS) that leverages the LLM's general abilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and coding for addressing spatial problems with automatic spatial data collection, analysis, and visualization. We envision that autonomous GIS will need to achieve five autonomous goals: self-generating, self-organizing, self-verifying, self-executing, and self-growing. We developed a prototype system called LLM-Geo using the GPT-4 API, demonstrating what an autonomous GIS looks like and how it delivers expected results without human intervention using three case studies. For all case studies, LLM-Geo returned accurate results, including aggregated numbers, graphs, and maps. Although still in its infancy and lacking several important modules such as logging and code testing, LLM-Geo demonstrates a potential path toward the next-generation AI-powered GIS. We advocate for the GIScience community to devote more efforts to the research and development of autonomous GIS, making spatial analysis easier, faster, and more accessible to a broader audience. © 2023 The Author(s).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating knowledge from external databases. This enhances the accuracy and credibility of the generation, particularly for knowledge-intensive tasks, and allows for continuous knowledge updates and integration of domain-specific information. RAG synergistically merges LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases. This comprehensive review paper offers a detailed examination of the progression of RAG paradigms, encompassing the Naive RAG, the Advanced RAG, and the Modular RAG. It meticulously scrutinizes the tripartite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques. The paper highlights the state-of-the-art technologies embedded in each of these critical components, providing a profound understanding of the advancements in RAG systems.

Thus, this paper introduces FLEX (False-Less EXecution), a novel approach to evaluating text-to-SQL systems using large language models (LLMs) to emulate human expert-level evaluation of SQL queries. Our metric improves agreement with human experts (from 62 to 87.04 in Cohen's kappa) with comprehensive context and sophisticated criteria. Our extensive experiments yield several key insights: (1) Models' performance increases by over 2.6 points on average, substantially affecting rankings on Spider and BIRD benchmarks; (2) The underestimation of models in EX primarily stems from annotation quality issues; and (3) Model performance on particularly challenging questions tends to be overestimated.

Important LLMs for text creation, translation, and summarization are mentioned, including T5, BART, and BioGPT. LLM performance is evaluated using metrics including as accuracy, perplexity, BLEU score, and ROUGE score. Research is still being done because of issues with bias, overfitting, and real-time processing. Future directions include managing longer contexts, lowering bias, and increasing efficiency through methods like federated learning.
